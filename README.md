# keyboard3000
faster and even more ultimate [keyboard2000](https://github.com/gethiox/keyboard2000) implementation!

![preview](doc/preview.png)

## What it is?

Keyboard3000 is an ultimate midi event generator out of computer
keyboard presses, prepared for [Jack audio system](http://jackaudio.org/)

Project status is experimental but useful for now I think.
The only dependency is [Xthexder](https://github.com/xthexder)'s [go-jack](https://github.com/xthexder/go-jack) bindings

## Notes

Please keep in mind this software needs to have direct access to input devices
which is a **security risk**, always make sure that running code is trusted.

Do not run it under root, simply add `input` group to some temporary user instead.
Adding `input` group pernamently to your daily user is strongly **not recommended**.
